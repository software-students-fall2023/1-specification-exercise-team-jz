## Stakeholders

Celine Yu. Celine is my roommate and she likes to keep things organized. She spends a lot of time keeping track of a course requirements and making calendar events. It would be very helpful for her if there were an app that can generate a study plan and calendar automatically for her so she doesn't have to spend so much time making to-do lists in Notion. 

Four needs/frustrations:
1. being able to view critical information of syllabi for different courses at on place.
2. keep track of assignments, exams, and project deadlines.
3. keep track of goals for different assignments.
4. have a calendar of important events (assignments, exams, and project) created automatically.

## Product Vision Statement

Syllabus.io converts your syllabus into a personalized schedule and to-do list. syllabus.io reads basic course info, course content, assignment deadlines, exam dates, as well as grade percentage distribution from your uploaded syllabi and organizes the information into a personalized to-do list and schedule.
